            Hi! I’m a Frontend Developer with a focus on creating responsive,
            user-friendly web applications using Vue, React, JavaScript, and
            TypeScript. As a freelancer, I’ve worked with clients from various
            industries to deliver clean, functional websites that solve
            real-world problems.\ I enjoy the balance between design and logic
            in frontend development—turning concepts into smooth, interactive
            interfaces. I regularly use tools like Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion,
            and modern frameworks to enhance user experience and maintain
            scalability. Outside of work, I’m always learning and experimenting
            with new tech to stay sharp and up-to-date. I’m open to freelance
            projects, collaborations, or just a good chat about web development!
